        <h1>“She Walks in Beauty” by Lord Byron</h1>
            <p>
She walks in beauty, like the night<br>
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;<br>
And all thats best of dark and bright<br>
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;<br>
Thus mellowed to that tender light<br>
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.<br>
