        <h1>My Perfect Trip to Japan</h1>
            <p>Japan is a beautiful country with many amazing places to visit. I would love to see the cherry blossoms in spring, visit the temples in Kyoto, and try all the delicious food.</p>

            <p>First, I would go to Tokyo to experience the bustling city life and visit landmarks like the Tokyo Tower and Shibuya Crossing. Then, I would head to Kyoto to see the historic temples and traditional tea houses. Finally, I would relax in a hot spring in Hakone while enjoying views of Mount Fuji.</p>
